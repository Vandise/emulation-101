# Hardware - Memory

* A series of on-off switches in *8 bit* chunks (*1 byte*)
* Each byte is given a unique *address*, can be chained together
* Chip8 supports up to 4096 *bytes* of memory
* Programs are loaded into memory and start at *address* 512

![inline](http://dsearls.org/courses/C391OrgSys/Memory/Seq11.gif)

^ Reference branch 1.program on how memory can be addressed.
^ At address 0010 we have 0x10F0

---

# Hardware - Registers

* Memory built into a processor, faster then RAM
* Broken into General and Special purpose registers
* Chip8 has 16, *8-bit* general-purpose, registers called *Vx* (any data can be placed in them)
	* *x* is 0 - F (1 - 16)
* Register *VF*(16) is used for flags, math overflow, errors, etc.

^ branch 2.registers
^ demo how registers operate like memory

---

# Hardware - Registers (Cont)

* One *16-bit* register used for memory addressing (called *I*)
* One *16-bit* register containing the program counter (address position)
* One *8-bit* register containing the stack-pointer

---

# Hardware - Processor

* The brain of the computer
* Executes instructions and interacts with hardware

This is the core of our emulator, a piece of software that loads a program into *memory*, executes instructions and interprets what it should do. Update a register, read a memory address, display a sprite, etc.

^ branch 3.basic-cpu
^ demo executing instructions, setting a register value

---

# Hardware - Display

* Some sort of visual output. Monitors, TVs, LEDs.
* Atari had no video ram! RF channel 3 or 4 (NTSC/Analog)
* Rendered with Integrated Graphics, Graphics Cards
	* Display information is wrote to dedicated video memory
	* It is then rendered by the display hardware (PPU)
	* *Note that this is a extremely simplified version*
	* Chip8 uses a 64x32 pixel monochrome display (2kb)

^ 4.display
^ SDL and bit rendering with textures

# Questions this far?

*We will be going over Chip8 in much more detail, this was a brief introduction into the hardware we have to emulate*

Congratulations! You build your first, fragmented, emulator!

# Maths - Bitwise Operations

Manipulates *bits* in a byte with logical operations.

Chip8 instructions are 2 bytes (16-bits) long and broken into *4-bit* (*1-nybble*) chunks for interpretation. They can be combined to make a max *12-bit* value.

The following is a Chip8 instruction we need to parse:

```c
	// set register 2 to contain the value 16
	0x6210
	// OpCode: 0x6nvv - Set Register n to vv
	// However, 0x0200 is not "register 2", it's 512
	// It needs to be translated to a value of 1 - 16 by shifting it to the lower 4 bytes
```

---

# Maths - Logical AND ( & )

Performs a truthy check against each bit in a byte.

```c

     11001000  
   & 10111000 
     -------- 
   = 10001000
```

If both bits are 1, 1 is returned. If one or more bits are 0, 0 will be returned.

---

# Maths - Logical AND ( & ) Cont

```c
	// logical & with hex
	  0x6210  // 0110 0010 0001 0000
	& 0x0F00  // 0000 1111 0000 0000
	  ------
	= 0x0200 (512)
```

---

# Maths - Right Shift ( >> )

Shifts the first truthy bit a specified amount of bytes to the right.

```c
// 0x0200
   0010 0000 0000 >> 8
   ------
=  0000 0000 0010 ( 2 )
```

---

# Maths - Logical OR ( | )

Similar to bitwise AND, bitwise OR only operates at the bit level. Its result is a 1 if one of the either bits is 1 and zero only when both bits are 0.

```c
      11001000  
    | 10111000 
      -------- 
    = 11111000
```

---

# Maths - Logical OR ( | ) Cont

Before we can parse the instruction, we first need to *construct* it. Each instruction is 2 bytes:

```c

// construct the following instruction from two separate bytes:
// 0x62 0x10

uint16_t instruction;   // 0000 0000 0000 0000 ; 0x0000

instruction = 0x62 << 8; 
// => 0x6200

instruction = instruction | 0x10;
// => 0x6210

```

---

# Maths - Endianness

Endianness is the order of bytes and which is considered the "most" or "least" significant bit (positive/negative/highest-value). *See two's complement for more details*. 

```c
  
    Two's Complement Example:
      0x6a02
    Big Endian:
      low ---> high
        02   6a
    Mask:
      0x026a & 0xF000
          ^      ^
          |------|
      0x026a & 0xF000
        ^          ^
        |----------|  
  
```

# The Chip8 Matrix

Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input.

```c
// Example Chip8 program:
// Prints the number "0" to the screen

0x61 0x00 0xF1 0x29 0x62 0x10
0x63 0x05 0xD2 0x35 0x12 0x0A

```

^ chip8, ./bin/chip8 resources/pong --test

---

# Program Breakdown

```c
// ld_vx_byte
// - set register 1 to 0 (the single digit hex value to print)
0x61 0x00

// fx_ld_f_vx
// - index register points to register 1
0xF1 0x29

// ld_vx_byte
// - set register 2 to 16 ( the x position )
0x62 0x10

// ld_vx_byte
// - set register 3 to 5 ( the y position )
0x63 0x05

// drw_vx_vy_nibble
// - draw x value in reg 2, y value in reg 3, the number of pixels ( 5 )
// - index pointer contains register value
0xD2 0x35

// loop start
0x12 0x0A

```

# Emulating Memory

Chip8 has 8-bit registers and supports some "special" registers which are simply two registers combined together to create 16-bit registers. Chip8 is an *8-bit* machine, so we parse our program in 1 byte chunks and load each byte into memory.

```c
uint8_t  memory[4096]; // reserve 4kb of emulated memory
```

Note that our program starts at address 512 (0x200) in memory!

---

# Loading our Program into Memory

Once we have our memory array defined, we can populate it with our program:

```c

#define LD(byte) memory[512 + offset] = byte; offset++;

int offset = 0;
LD(0x61); LD(0x00);
LD(0xF1); LD(0x29);
LD(0x62); LD(0x10);
LD(0x63); LD(0x05);
LD(0xD2); LD(0x35);
LD(0x12); LD(0x0A);

```

---

# Emulating Registers and Stack

The registers and stack operate similar to memory, we're just limited to the amount of data that can be stored ( 1 byte in registers, 2 in the stack ).

```c
// initialize 16 registers, register 0 is not used
uint8_t  registers[16];

// the stack can hold 2 bytes, but is limited to 17 items -- FILO
uint16_t stack[16];
```



---

# Emulating the CPU

Emulating a CPU can be broken down into four steps:

- Run a CPU cycle (execute 1 instruction)
- Check if the video memory (buffer) has updated (if so, draw)
- Limit CPU speed, (pause the current thread)
- Repeat

---

# CPU Pseudocode

```c

while true

	chip8.cycle()
	if chip8.drawFlag
		for each address in video memory
			pixel = chip8.graphicsBuffer[address]
			convert pixel to 32bit video memory (using SDL2)
			push to display
		end
		display.refresh()
		sleep for 100ms
	end

end

```

---

# The CPU Cycle

```c
// Parse the opCode from memory
uint16_t = opCode = memory[programCounter] << 8 | memory[programCounter + 1];
// keep track of our position in memory
programCounter += 2;

// extract the instruction
uint16_t instruction = opCode & 0xF000;

// execute the instruction
if ( instructions.count(instruction) )
{
	(instructions[instruction])();
}
else
{
	cout << "Unimplemented OpCode: " << opCode << std::endl;
	exit(1);
}

```

---

# The CPU Cycle - Instruction

```c

#define MASK(hex) ((opCode & hex))

// load a value into register x
// instruction 0x6000
void ld_vx_byte()
{
	// extract the register, shift 8 bits to the right
	// extract the value from the last byte
	registers[MASK(0x0F00) >> 8] = MASK(0x00FF);
}

// add the instructions to the hashmap
instructions[0x6000] = &ld_vx_byte;

```

---

# Displaying the Screen

For emulating a monochrome screen, SDL is an excellent library to support this. It accepts one parameter after being configured: a vector of bits. These bits and their position represent where a pixel will be filled in.

Whenever the CPU sets a drawFlag, we update the screen:

```c
// pixelBuffer is our vector of bits
SDL_UpdateTexture(sdlTexture, NULL, pixelBuffer);
```

---

# Demo - Pong!

Requires SDL2. Note: not all instructions have been implemented, Pong is the only game tested.
Currently have not implemented user controls.

```bash

$ git clone https://github.com/Vandise/Chip8
$ cd Chip8
$ make
$ ./bin/c8 resources/pong

# for our test program to draw 0 to the screen
$ ./bin/c8 resources/pong --test

```

---

# Reflections

* Endianness can really screw up your emulator!
	* Some Chip8 programs use different Endianness or chose not to use Two's Complement
	* It made debugging with other games a challenge
* It was amazing on how storage conscious some programmers were in the 1970s. Not a single *bit* is wasted in the Chip8 instruction set
* Pong isn't smart enough to question the matrix in which I put it in
